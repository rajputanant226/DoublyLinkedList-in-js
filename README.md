🔁 Doubly Linked List in JavaScript

This project implements a Doubly Linked List (DLL) in JavaScript (ES6) to understand how data structures work internally using syntax.

---

📘 Overview

A Doubly Linked List is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains:
- Data (the stored value)
- A pointer to the next node
- A pointer to the previous node

This allows traversal of the list in both forward and backward directions.

🧩 Features

✅ Insert a node:
- At the beginning
- At the end
- At a specific position

✅ Delete a node:
- From the beginning
- From the end
- From a specific position

✅ Traverse the list:
- Forward traversal (head → tail)
- Backward traversal (tail → head)

✅ Display the list in the console.
